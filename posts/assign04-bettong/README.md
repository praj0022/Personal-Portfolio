# Assignment 4 materials

These are the materials for assignment 4 for 2024 ETC5521.

- Clicking on the GitHub assignment link provided in moodle, will generate a repo that you have access to, to read, to write, containing the files on this template. You will also have admin access, to add an additional team member.
- You should complete your answers in the file `report.qmd`.
- Instructions are in `assign04_1.html`, also.
- Make sure you knit your `report.qmd` file, commit and push the resulting `html` file to your repo.
- Data created should be saved in the `data` directory. 
- Updates to the meeting diary need to be mad and pushed to the repo after each discussion.

This is a team assignment and you will be working one (or two) other class members. Team work means that all members are responsible for all parts of the work. Specifically, although it is a good idea to give each person primary responsibility for separate parts, so each obtains some leadership experience, you are also responsible for your team members results. If there are differences of opinion, you should work to resolve these. 

ALL WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE ONE THE `main` BRANCH. DO NOT CREATE SEPARATE BRANCHES FOR EACH TEAM MEMBER. Evidence of a strong collaboration is commits on the same files. 

If you do have challenges working with your team you are welcome to detail the issues in a *private message to the teaching staff* in the ED forum. We will do our best to resolve them, so that your team work experience is rewarding, and helps your learning.
