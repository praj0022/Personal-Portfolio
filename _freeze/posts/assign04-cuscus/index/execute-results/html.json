These particles originate from various sources, such as traffic emissions, industrial activities, construction sites, and natural sources like pollen and dust. Because they are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, high concentrations of `pm25`, `pm10` are associated with poor air quality and can lead to serious health issues, including respiratory and cardiovascular problems.\n\n- *Sulfur dioxide* (`so2`) is a colorless gas that is readily soluble in water. It mainly comes from the combustion of fossil fuels for domestic heating, industries and power generation. Exposure to SO2 is associated with asthma hospital admissions and emergency room visits.\n\n- *Ozone* (`o3`) is a key ingredient in smog, created when sunlight reacts with pollutants like volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides from vehicles and industries. Because it forms in sunlight, ozone levels are often highest on sunny days. Additionally, some household devices, like portable air cleaners, can also produce ozone. Exposure to excessive ozone can cause problems breathing, trigger asthma, reduce lung function and lead to lung disease. \n\n- *Nitrogen dioxide* (`no2`) is a reddish-brown gas that is soluble in water, and a strong oxidant. It mainly comes from burning fuels in heating, transportation, industry, and power generation, as well as from household appliances like furnaces and gas stoves. Exposure to NO₂ can irritate the airways and worsen respiratory diseases. It also contributes to ozone formation, linking it to asthma and other respiratory issues.\n\n- *Carbon monoxide* (`co`) is a colorless, odorless gas produced from the incomplete burning of fuels like wood, petrol, coal, and natural gas. The main source of CO in the air is motor vehicles. Carbon monoxide diffuses across the lung tissues and into the bloodstream, making it difficult for the body’s cells to bind to oxygen. This lack of oxygen damages tissues and cells. Exposure to carbon monoxide can cause difficulties breathing, exhaustion, dizziness, and other flu-like symptoms. Exposure to high levels of carbon monoxide can be deadly.\n\n**Do different sensors at the same location report the same values?**\n\nThe question being assessed focuses on analyzing if sensors placed within close proximity report same values. Analyzing data from these varied suburban and urban sensors helps to determine if air quality measurements are consistent across these distinct environments or if local geographic and environmental factors lead to significant differences in reported values. Such insights will clarify how air quality varies across coastal and urban settings, helping to assess whether sensor readings can be directly compared or if adjustments are needed for accurate regional air quality assessments. This can improve the relevance of public health responses and policies specific to each area’s unique conditions.\n\n\n**Expectations**:\n\n- Sensor data from locations like Melbourne are expected to show higher pollution levels compared to areas like Geelong South, which is closer to the coast.\n\n- A positive correlation is anticipated between pollutant levels, where an increase in one pollutant is likely to correspond with increases in others.\n\n- Weekday and weekend trends in pollutant levels are expected to differ, potentially reflecting variations in daily activities and emissions.\n\n**Limitations**:\n\n- Not all locations have sensors that measure every pollutant. Most sensors capture data for only two pollutants, with exceptions like Alphington and Geelong South, which measure a broader range.\n\n- There may be significant missing data for certain pollutants, which could affect analysis outcomes.\n\n- The varying scales and units of pollutants may complicate direct comparisons.\n\n- As the data originates from third-party organizations and government agencies, there could be occasional concerns about data accuracy and consistency.\n\n\n## Data description\n\n\n**Data Source**\n\nOpenAQ is an open-source platform that aggregates real-time air quality data from governmental and research sources worldwide. Using sensors managed by environmental agencies, OpenAQ collects pollutant measurements such as PM2.5, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide. The data is standardized and made accessible on their platform, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the public to monitor air quality, track trends, and support efforts to enhance environmental health globally.\n\n**License**\n\nOpenAQ provides air quality data aggregated from multiple sources, each with its own licensing terms. While some data might be available under open licenses such as Creative Commons (e.g., CC0), others may require attribution, restrict commercial use, or have specific conditions as determined by the original providers. OpenAQ includes these license details to ensure users comply with any necessary terms when accessing or using the data.\n\n**Data**\n\nThis dataset captures air quality measurements across various locations in Australia, focusing on pollutant levels such as particulate matter (e.g., PM10, PM2.5) over time. It provides spatial and temporal data, including the concentration of pollutants, the geographic location of sampling sites, and time-stamps for when each measurement was recorded. The data allows for a detailed analysis of air quality trends, helping to assess pollution levels and their potential impacts on public health. By studying these pollutant concentrations over time and location, it becomes possible to identify pollution hot spots, track seasonal variations, and evaluate overall compliance with air quality standards.\n\nThe dataset contains 36,326 rows and 9 columns. The variables in the dataset are as follows: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\ndata_description <- data.frame(\n  Variable = c(\"location_id\", \"location\", \"parameter\", \"value\", \"date_utc\", \"unit\", \"lat\", \"long\", \"country\"),\n  Description = c(\n    \"Unique identifier for each location.\",\n    \"Name of the location where measurements were taken.\",\n    \"Type of pollutant measured: PM10, PM25, SO2, NO2, CO, O3\",\n    \"Recorded value of the pollutant.\",\n    \"Timestamp in UTC for the recorded measurement\",\n    \"Measurement unit, primarily µg/m³ and ppm\",\n    \"Latitude co-ordinates for the location\",\n    \"Longitude co-ordinates for the location\",\n    \"Country code (AU for all records)\"\n  ),\n  stringsAsFactors = FALSE\n)\n\nkable(data_description, caption = \"Description of Data Variables\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Description of Data Variables\n\n|Variable    |Description                                              |\n|:-----------|:--------------------------------------------------------|\n|location_id |Unique identifier for each location.                     |\n|location    |Name of the location where measurements were taken.      |\n|parameter   |Type of pollutant measured: PM10, PM25, SO2, NO2, CO, O3 |\n|value       |Recorded value of the pollutant.                         |\n|date_utc    |Timestamp in UTC for the recorded measurement            |\n|unit        |Measurement unit, primarily µg/m³ and ppm                |\n|lat         |Latitude co-ordinates for the location                   |\n|long        |Longitude co-ordinates for the location                  |\n|country     |Country code (AU for all records)                        |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Data Checking and Cleaning Methods** \n\n- **Data Type Validation**: - It is necessary to ensure that each column has the correct data type. For example, date_utc should be in datetime format for time series analysis. \n- **Handling Missing or Null values**: Although no null values are detected, there may still be missing or erroneous data entries. It’s essential to review columns like value for potential issues like zero or extreme values that may indicate faulty measurements. Further, we might be able to discover missing values once the data is transformed into tidy form. \n- **Duplicate Records**: Given that location_id and date_utc might uniquely identify each record, checking duplicates based on these columns to prevent redundant data.\n- **Outlier Detection**: The value column could contain outliers. Outliers could be identified using statistical methods like IQR analysis. This is particularly important in environmental data to avoid skewed analyses.\n- **Unit Consistency**: Ensure all entries use consistent units for accurate analysis.\n- **Location Summary**: Check the number of observations at each location to determine if it is consistent for the selected time period. \n- **Parameter Distribution**: Check for consistency in number of parameters measured at each location. \n\n<!--\nDownload the data you need to answer your questions.

Alphington and Geelong South each have approximately 8,000 observations, while Dandenong records around 6,000, with other locations having significantly fewer observations. This suggests that not all sensors capture data for every pollutant. Further, on exploring the number of parameters detected at each sensor location we can confirm that only Alphington and Geelong South detect all six pollutants.

Additionally, Alphington had gaps on July 15th at 05:00 and August 15th at 10:00, while Geelong South also missed data on August 15th at 10:00. Geelong South experienced a unique three-hour gap on August 22nd from 01:00 to 03:00.\n\n**Analysis of Possible Factors Contributing to Missing Data**\n\nBased on information from the OpenAQ documentation and GitHub resources, potential causes of data gaps across different sensor locations may include: \n\n1. Monitoring stations typically measure specific pollutants based on local priorities, regulations, and resources, leading to incomplete data coverage for certain pollutants across regions.\n\n2. OpenAQ uses both reference monitors and low-cost sensors. While low-cost sensors expand coverage, they may inconsistently measure pollutants like PM10 due to calibration and environmental factors, resulting in data gaps.\n\n3. OpenAQ collects data from various government and third-party sources, each with different reporting practices. Changes in data-sharing agreements, or provider disruptions can cause temporary data gaps for certain pollutants.\n\n4. Technical disruptions, such as routine sensor maintenance, calibration, network outages, power failures, and equipment malfunctions, can temporarily pause data transmission, leading to missing data.\n\nWhile the above offer a general overview of data handling and reasons for data gaps on the OpenAQ platform. For specific details on missing data, consulting the relevant data provider or monitoring station is often necessary, as they may have insights into the cause.\n\n\n#### Detecting Outliers\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nggplot(alp_gee |> filter(parameter == c(\"pm10\", \"pm25\")) , aes(x = value)) +      geom_boxplot() + \n  facet_wrap(~parameter ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the boxplots we can deduce the following:\n\n- `pm10` has a wider spread and greater variability compared to `pm25`. Both pollutants have a narrow IQR, indicating low variability within the central 50% of values, with most data concentrated near the median. However, both also have numerous outliers, which are more extreme in `pm10` The spike in `pm10` levels may result from events like dust storms, construction, or excessive road dust, while the elevated `pm25` levels likely stem from combustion sources such as vehicle exhaust during peak traffic hours.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nggplot(alp_gee |> filter(!(parameter %in% c(\"pm10\", \"pm25\"))), aes(x = value)) + \n       geom_boxplot() + \n  facet_wrap(~parameter, scales = \"free_x\" ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n- The `co` boxplot shows a narrow IQR, indicating low variability within the central 50% of data. The short whiskers and numerous outliers (up to about 1.5 ppm) suggest a concentrated distribution around the median but substantial variability in extreme values, suggesting occasional spikes in `co` concentration.\n\n- The `no2` boxplot reveals a narrow IQR, signifying low variability within the central 50% of data. The whiskers extend just beyond the box, with outliers reaching up to 0.06 ppm, indicating occasional peaks in `no2` concentrations and moderate variability in extreme values, though not as pronounced as for `co`.\n\n- The `o3` boxplot shows a relatively wide IQR, indicating moderate variability within the central 50% of the data. The median is slightly off-center, and the whiskers are slightly unequal, suggesting a slight asymmetry in the distribution. The absence of outliers indicates that `o3` values are spread consistently within the range, with no extreme deviations, leading to a stable variability overall.\n\n- The `so2` boxplot shows a narrow IQR, similar to `co` and `no2`, signifying a low variability in the central 50% of values. The short whiskers and presence of outliers up to 0.008 ppm suggest a concentrated distribution around the median, with occasional high values adding to overall variability.\n\n- The outliers in each of the pollutant may be attributed to factors like emissions from combustion, peak traffic periods, seasonal variations (holiday, non-holiday period), weather conditions like high humidity, natural events like wildfires or could possibly be anomalies in measurements. These would provide additional perspective while doing further analysis and best to retain them.\n\n\n**Summary mean/median of each measurements**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\noptions(scipen = 999)\n\nskim_summary <- data_wider |> \n  skim(pm25, pm10, so2, o3, no2, co) \n\nskim_summary <- skim_summary |> \n  select(-c(n_missing, numeric.hist, complete_rate))\n  \n\nskim_summary\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\nTable: Data summary\n\n|                         |           |\n|:------------------------|:----------|\n|Name                     |data_wider |\n|Number of rows           |2946       |\n|Number of columns        |12         |\n|_______________________  |           |\n|Column type frequency:   |           |\n|numeric                  |6          |\n|________________________ |           |\n|Group variables          |None       |\n\n\n**Variable type: numeric**\n\n|skim_variable |  mean|    sd|   p0|  p25|   p50|   p75|   p100|\n|:-------------|-----:|-----:|----:|----:|-----:|-----:|------:|\n|pm25          |  6.82|  6.96| 0.00| 2.67|  4.96|  8.60|  63.01|\n|pm10          | 19.83| 17.85| 0.00| 9.66| 14.88| 23.32| 188.09|\n|so2           |  0.00|  0.00| 0.00| 0.00|  0.00|  0.00|   0.01|\n|o3            |  0.02|  0.01| 0.00| 0.01|  0.02|  0.03|   0.04|\n|no2           |  0.01|  0.01| 0.00| 0.00|  0.01|  0.01|   0.07|\n|co            |  0.21|  0.18| 0.04| 0.11|  0.14|  0.22|   1.55|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOverall, `pm25` has an average concentration of 6.82 µg/m³, with a standard deviation of 6.96, indicating variability in measurements.

Alphington consistently has higher peaks than Geelong South.\n\n- Alphington frequently surpasses 0.5 ppm, with some peaks over 1.0 ppm. Geelong South generally stays below 0.5 ppm and exhibits fewer fluctuations.\n\n- High Spikes in Early July and August, Alphington shows significant spikes on July 2nd to 4th, and August 3rd-4th, reaching over 1.0 ppm, not seen at Geelong South except on July 3rd. Although, most high spikes but in reduced levels for Geelong appear around the same time. \n\n- Low Variability in late August, both locations show reduced `co` levels and minimal fluctuations, possibly due to improved dispersion conditions. Similar trend can be observed in July, from 19th to 26th, although there is data missing on July 19th. \n\n- While weekdays have more pronounced peaks, both locations follow a similar pattern across all days, with Alphington displaying consistently higher `co` due to its urban environment.\n\n\n## Summary \n\nOverall, the sensors in Alphington and Geelong South do not consistently report the same values: \n\n- `pm25` concentrations in both locations are generally below 20 µg/m³ on most days, which is within the safe threshold of 25 µg/m³. However, Alphington generally records more higher values, with peaks reaching up to 60 µg/m³ compared to Geelong South’s maximum of 40 µg/m³.\n\n- `pm10` concentrations in both locations mostly remain below 20 µg/m³, which is well under the recommended limit of 50 µg/m³. However, Geelong South frequently experiences higher values, exceeding 50 µg/m³ and even surpassing 100 µg/m³, whereas Alphington’s peak levels reach only around 60 µg/m³.\n\n- `so2` concentrations typically range from 0 to 0.001 ppm in both locations, staying within the safe range of 0 to 0.005 ppm. However, Geelong South occasionally experiences spikes with higher levels, reaching between 0.006 and 0.008 ppm.\n\n- `o3` concentrations at Alphington and Geelong South range from approximately 0 ppm to over 0.03 ppm, with both locations displaying similar trends in average levels. Both remain within the safe limit of 0.07 ppm for 8-hour exposure. However, Geelong South tends to show higher levels, particularly in the morning.\n\n- `no2` concentrations typically range from 0.00 ppm to 0.04 ppm in both locations, remaining below the safe limit of 0.08 ppm for one-hour exposure. Only on July 3, Geelong South recorded a high peak of 0.06 ppm at night. Due to missing data for Geelong South in August, trends during this period are uncertain, but both locations exhibited similar daily average values in July.\n\n- `co` concentrations in both locations peak at the start of each month, with Alphington consistently higher, reaching up to 1-1.5 ppm. Despite these peaks, both locations remain well below the safe limit of 6 ppm for 8-hour exposure. \n\n\nIn conclusion, although we expect that Alphington will be more polluted than Geelong South due to its proximity to the Melbourne CBD, which is more crowded, Geelong South still faces more frequent and significant spikes in `pm10` and `so2`. This indicates a potential for health risks in that area as well. The consistently higher pollution levels of the other pollutants in Alphington suggest urban influences, likely from traffic and other sources. Further, there doesn't seem to appear a different trend on weekdays compared to weekends. The variations and patterns are quite similar on all days of the week. In addition, the expectation of positive correlations among pollutants was partially met, with strong positive correlations between `pm25` and `co` (0.79), and moderate positive correlations between `no2` and `co` (0.65). However, unexpected negative correlations were observed between `o3` and both `no2` (-0.78) and `co` (-0.7), which diverges from the anticipated trend, suggesting a more complex relationship involving ozone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## References\n\n1.
